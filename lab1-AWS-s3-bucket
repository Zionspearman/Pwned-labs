# Lab 1 â€“ AWS S3 Bucket Enumeration & Account ID Discovery

## ðŸ§  Objective
Perform enumeration and exploitation of a misconfigured AWS S3 bucket to:
- Discover if the bucket is public
- Extract sensitive metadata (like the AWS Account ID)
- Identify further cloud resource exposures (e.g., EBS snapshot)

---

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- **Kali Linux**
- **AWS CLI**
- **Nmap**
- **curl**
- **Browser**
- **s3-account-search** (open-source enumeration tool)

---

## ðŸ§ª Steps Taken

### 1. Configure AWS CLI and Verify Identity
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
---

### 2. Check If S3 Bucket Exists
Used `curl` to check the bucket headers:
```bash
curl -I http://mega-big-tech.s3.amazonaws.com
---

### 3. Perform Nmap Scan on Web Server
Used Nmap to scan the target IP and check for open ports:
```bash
nmap -Pn 54.204.171.32
---

### 4. Access S3 Bucket via Web Browser
Used a browser to view the bucket contents directly:
http://mega-big-tech.s3.amazonaws.com/
---

### 5. Brute-Force AWS Account ID Using s3-account-search
Used `s3-account-search` to enumerate the AWS Account ID via IAM role policy wildcards:
```bash
s3-account-search arn:aws:iam::107513503799:role/LeakyBucket mega-big-tech
---

### 6. Discover Public EBS Snapshot
Searched for public EBS snapshots using the discovered AWS Account ID in the AWS Console.

âœ… Results:
- Located an **8 GiB public EBS snapshot** linked to account ID `107513503799`
- Snapshot was unencrypted and publicly accessible
- This represents a serious cloud security risk, as the snapshot could be copied and analyzed offline
